<h2 id="pgepubid00017">CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p>Staines fell head-foremost into the sea with a heavy plunge. Being an excellent swimmer, he struck out the moment he touched the water, and that arrested his dive, and brought him up with a slant, shocked and panting, drenched and confused. The next moment he saw, as through a fog—his eyes being full of water—something fall from the ship. He breasted the big waves, and swam towards it: it rose on the top of a wave, and he saw it was a life-buoy. Encumbered with wet clothes, he seemed impotent in the big waves; they threw him up so high, and down so low.</p>
<p>Almost exhausted, he got to the life-buoy, and clutched it with a fierce grasp and a wild cry of delight. He got it over his head, and, placing his arms round the buoyant circle, stood with his breast and head out of water, gasping.</p>
<p>He now drew a long breath, and got his wet hair out of his eyes, already smarting with salt water, and, raising himself on the buoy, looked out for help.</p>
<p>He saw, to his great concern, the ship already at a distance. She seemed to have flown, and she was still drifting fast away from him.</p>
<p>He saw no signs of help. His heart began to turn as cold as his drenched body. A horrible fear crossed him.</p>
<p>But presently he saw the weather-boat filled, and fall into the water; and then a wave rolled between him and the ship, and he only saw her topmast.</p>
<p>The next time he rose on a mighty wave he saw the boats together astern of the vessel, but not coming his way; and the gloom was thickening, the ship becoming indistinct, and all was doubt and horror.</p>
<p>A life of agony passed in a few minutes.</p>
<p>He rose and fell like a cork on the buoyant waves—rose and fell, and saw nothing but the ship’s lights, now terribly distant.</p>
<p>But at last, as he rose and fell, he caught a few fitful glimpses of a smaller light rising and falling like himself. “A boat!” he cried, and raising himself as high as he could, shouted, cried, implored for help. He stretched his hands across the water. “This way! this way!”</p>
<p>The light kept moving, but it came no nearer. They had greatly underrated the drift. The other boat had no light.</p>
<p>Minutes passed of suspense, hope, doubt, dismay, terror. Those minutes seemed hours.</p>
<p>In the agony of suspense the quaking heart sent beads of sweat to the brow, though the body was immersed.</p>
<p>And the gloom deepened, and the cold waves flung him up to heaven with their giant arms, and then down again to hell: and still that light, his only hope, was several hundred yards from him.</p>
<p>Only for a moment at a time could his eyeballs, straining with agony, catch this will-o’-the-wisp, the boat’s light. It groped the sea up and down, but came no near.</p>
<p>When what seemed days of agony had passed, suddenly a rocket rose in the horizon—so it seemed to him.</p>
<p>The lost man gave a shriek of joy; so prone are we to interpret things hopefully.</p>
<p>Misery! The next time he saw that little light, that solitary spark of hope, it was not quite so near as before. A mortal sickness fell on his heart. The ship had recalled the boats by rocket.</p>
<p>He shrieked, he cried, he screamed, he raved. “Oh, Rosa! Rosa! for her sake, men, men, do not leave me. I am here! here!”</p>
<p>In vain. The miserable man saw the boat’s little light retire, recede, and melt into the ship’s larger light, and that light glided away.</p>
<p>Then, a cold, deadly stupor fell on him. Then, death’s icy claw seized his heart, and seemed to run from it to every part of him. He was a dead man. Only a question of time. Nothing to gain by floating.</p>
<p>But the despairing mind could not quit the world in peace, and even here in the cold, cruel sea, the quivering body clung to this fragment of life, and winced at death’s touch, though more merciful.</p>
<p>He despised this weakness; he raged at it; he could not overcome it.</p>
<p>Unable to live or to die, condemned to float slowly, hour by hour, down into death’s jaws.</p>
<p>To a long, death-like stupor succeeded frenzy. Fury seized this great and long-suffering mind. It rose against the cruelty and injustice of his fate. He cursed the world, whose stupidity had driven him to sea, he cursed remorseless nature; and at last he railed on the God who made him, and made the cruel water, that was waiting for his body. “God’s justice! God’s mercy! God’s power! they are all lies,” he shouted, “dreams, chimeras, like Him the all-powerful and good, men babble of by the fire. If there was a God more powerful than the sea, and only half as good as men are, he would pity my poor Rosa and me, and send a hurricane to drive those caitiffs back to the wretch they have abandoned. Nature alone is mighty. Oh, if I could have her on my side, and only God against me! But she is as deaf to prayer as He is: as mechanical and remorseless. I am a bubble melting into the sea. Soul I have none; my body will soon be nothing, nothing. So ends an honest, loving life. I always tried to love my fellow-creatures. Curse them! curse them! Curse the earth! Curse the sea! Curse all nature: there is no other God for me to curse.”</p>
<p>The moon came out.</p>
<p>He raised his head and staring eyeballs, and cursed her.</p>
<p>The wind began to whistle, and flung spray in his face.</p>
<p>He raised his fallen head and staring eyeballs, and cursed the wind.</p>
<p>While he was thus raving, he became sensible of a black object to windward.</p>
<p>It looked like a rail, and a man leaning on it.</p>
<p>He stared, he cleared the wet hair from his eyes, and stared again.</p>
<p>The thing, being larger than himself and partly out of water, was drifting to leeward faster than himself.</p>
<p>He stared and trembled, and at last it came nearly abreast, black, black.</p>
<p>He gave a loud cry, and tried to swim towards it; but encumbered with his life-buoy, he made little progress. The thing drifted abreast of him, but ten yards distant.</p>
<p>As they each rose high upon the waves, he saw it plainly.</p>
<p>It was the very raft that had been the innocent cause of his sad fate.</p>
<p>He shouted with hope, he swam, he struggled; he got near it, but not to it; it drifted past, and he lost his chance of intercepting it. He struggled after it. The life-buoy would not let him catch it.</p>
<p>Then he gave a cry of agony, rage, despair, and flung off the life-buoy, and risked all on this one chance.</p>
<p>He gains a little on the raft.</p>
<p>He loses.</p>
<p>He gains: he cries, “Rosa! Rosa!” and struggles with all his soul, as well as his body: he gains.</p>
<p>But when almost within reach, a wave half drowns him, and he loses.</p>
<p>He cries, “Rosa! Rosa!” and swims high and strong. “Rosa! Rosa! Rosa!”</p>
<p>He is near it. He cries, “Rosa! Rosa!” and with all the energy of love and life flings himself almost out of the water, and catches hold of the nearest thing on the raft.</p>
<p>It was the dead man’s leg.</p>
<p>It seemed as if it would come away in his grasp. He dared not try to pull himself up by that. But he held on by it, panting, exhausting, faint.</p>
<p>This faintness terrified him. “Oh,” thought he, “if I faint now, all is over.”</p>
<p>Holding by that terrible and strange support, he made a grasp, and caught hold of the woodwork at the bottom of the rail. He tried to draw himself up. Impossible.</p>
<p>He was no better off than with his life-buoy.</p>
<p>But in situations so dreadful, men think fast; he worked gradually round the bottom of the raft by his hands, till he got to leeward, still holding on. There he found a solid block of wood at the edge of the raft. He prised himself carefully up; the raft in that part then sank a little: he got his knee upon the timber of the raft, and with a wild cry seized the nearest upright, and threw both arms round it and clung tight. Then first he found breath to speak. “THANK GOD!” he cried, kneeling on the timber, and grasping the upright post—“OH, THANK GOD! THANK GOD!”</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00018">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<p>“Thank God!” why, according to his theory, it should have been “Thank Nature.” But I observe that, in such cases, even philosophers are ungrateful to the mistress they worship.</p>
<p>Our philosopher not only thanked God, but being on his knees, prayed forgiveness for his late ravings, prayed hard, with one arm curled round the upright, lest the sea, which ever and anon rushed over the bottom of the raft, should swallow him up in a moment.</p>
<p>Then he rose carefully, and wedged himself into the corner of the raft opposite to that other figure, ominous relic of the wild voyage the new-comer had entered upon; he put both arms over the rail, and stood erect.</p>
<p>The moon was now up; but so was the breeze: fleecy clouds flew with vast rapidity across her bright face, and it was by fitful though vivid glances Staines examined the raft and his companion.</p>
<p>The raft was large, and well made of timbers tied and nailed together, and a strong rail ran round it resting on several uprights. There were also some blocks of a very light wood screwed to the horizontal timbers, and these made it float high.</p>
<p>But what arrested and fascinated the man’s gaze was his dead companion, sole survivor, doubtless, of a horrible voyage, since the raft was not made for one, nor by one.</p>
<p>It was a skeleton, or nearly, whose clothes the seabirds had torn, and pecked every limb in all the fleshy parts; the rest of the body had dried to dark leather on the bones. The head was little more than an eyeless skull; but in the fitful moonlight, those huge hollow caverns seemed gigantic lamp-like eyes, and glared at him fiendishly, appallingly.</p>
<p>He sickened at the sight. He tried not to look at it; but it would be looked at, and threaten him in the moonlight, with great lack-lustre eyes.</p>
<p>The wind whistled, and lashed his face with spray torn off the big waves, and the water was nearly up to his knees, and the raft tossed so wildly, it was all he could do to hold on in his corner: in which struggle, still those monstrous lack-lustre eyes, like lamps of death, glared at him in the moon; all else was dark, except the fiery crests of the black mountain-billows, tumbling and raging all around.</p>
<p>What a night!</p>
<p>But, before morning, the breeze sank, the moon set, and a sombre quiet succeeded, with only that grim figure in outline dimly visible. Owing to the motion still retained by the waves, it seemed to nod and rear, and be ever preparing to rush upon him.</p>
<p>The sun rose glorious, on a lovely scene; the sky was a very mosaic of colors sweet and vivid, and the tranquil, rippling sea, peach-colored to the horizon, with lines of diamonds where the myriad ripples broke into smiles.</p>
<p>Staines was asleep, exhausted. Soon the light awoke him, and he looked up. What an incongruous picture met his eye: that heaven of color all above and around, and right before him, like a devil stuck in mid-heaven, that grinning corpse, whose fate foreshadowed his own.</p>
<p>But daylight is a great strengthener of the nerves; the figure no longer appalled him—a man who had long learned to look with Science’s calm eye upon the dead. When the sea became like glass, and from peach-color deepened to rose, he walked along the raft, and inspected the dead man. He found it was a man of color, but not a black. The body was not kept in its place, as he had supposed, merely by being jammed into the angle caused by the rail; it was also lashed to the corner upright by a long, stout belt. Staines concluded this had kept the body there, and its companions had been swept away.</p>
<p>This was not lost on him: he removed the belt for his own use: he then found it was not only a belt, but a receptacle; it was nearly full of small, hard substances that felt like stones.</p>
<p>When he had taken it off the body, he felt a compunction. “Ought he to rob the dead, and expose it to be swept into the sea at the first wave, like a dead dog?”</p>
<p>He was about to replace the belt, when a middle course occurred to him. He was a man who always carried certain useful little things about him, viz., needles, thread, scissors, and string. He took a piece of string, and easily secured this poor light skeleton to the raft. The belt he strapped to the rail, and kept for his own need.</p>
<p>And now hunger gnawed him. No food was near. There was nothing but the lovely sea and sky, mosaic with color, and that grim, ominous skeleton.</p>
<p>Hunger comes and goes many times before it becomes insupportable. All that day and night, and the next day, he suffered its pangs; and then it became torture, but the thirst maddening.</p>
<p>Towards night fell a gentle rain. He spread a handkerchief and caught it. He sucked the handkerchief.</p>
<p>This revived him, and even allayed in some degree the pangs of hunger.</p>
<p>Next day was cloudless. A hot sun glared on his unprotected head, and battered down his enfeebled frame.</p>
<p>He resisted as well as he could. He often dipped his head, and as often the persistent sun, with cruel glare, made it smoke again.</p>
<p>Next day the same: but the strength to meet it was waning. He lay down and thought of Rosa, and wept bitterly. He took the dead man’s belt, and lashed himself to the upright. That act, and his tears for his beloved, were almost his last acts of perfect reason: for next day came the delusions and the dreams that succeed when hunger ceases to torture, and the vital powers begin to ebb. He lay and saw pleasant meadows with meandering streams, and clusters of rich fruit that courted the hand and melted in the mouth.</p>
<p>Ever and anon they vanished, and he saw grim death looking down on him with those big cavernous eyes.</p>
<p>By and by, whether his body’s eye saw the grim skeleton, or his mind’s eye the juicy fruits, green meadows, and pearly brooks, all was shadowy.</p>
<p>So, in a placid calm, beneath a blue sky, the raft drifted dead, with its dead freight, upon the glassy purple, and he drifted, too, towards the world unknown.</p>
<p>There came across the waters to that dismal raft a thing none too common, by sea or land—a good man.</p>
<p>He was tall, stalwart, bronzed, and had hair like snow, before his time, for he had known trouble. He commanded a merchant steamer, bound for Calcutta, on the old route.</p>
<p>The man at the mast-head descried a floating wreck, and hailed the deck accordingly. The captain altered his course without one moment’s hesitation, and brought up alongside, lowered a boat, and brought the dead, and the breathing man, on board.</p>
<p>A young middy lifted Staines in his arms from the wreck to the boat; he whose person I described in chapter one weighed now no more than that.</p>
<p>Men are not always rougher than women. Their strength and nerve enable them now and then to be gentler than buttery-fingered angels, who drop frail things through sensitive agitation, and break them. These rough men saw Staines was hovering between life and death, and they handled him like a thing the ebbing life might be shaken out of in a moment. It was pretty to see how gingerly the sailors carried the sinking man up the ladder, and one fetched swabs, and the others laid him down softly on them at their captain’s feet.</p>
<p>“Well done, men,” said he. “Poor fellow! Pray Heaven, we may not have come too late. Now stand aloof a bit. Send the surgeon aft.”</p>
<p>The surgeon came, and looked, and felt the heart. He shook his head, and called for brandy. He had Staines’s head raised, and got half a spoonful of diluted brandy down his throat. But there was an ominous gurgling.</p>
<p>After several such attempts at intervals, he said plainly the man’s life could not be saved by ordinary means.</p>
<p>“Then try extraordinary,” said the captain. “My orders are that he is to be saved. There is life in him. You have only got to keep it there. He MUST be saved; he SHALL be saved.”</p>
<p>“I should like to try Dr. Staines’s remedy,” said the surgeon.</p>
<p>“Try it, then what is it?”</p>
<p>“A bath of beef-tea. Dr. Staines says he applied it to a starved child—in the Lancet.”</p>
<p>“Take a hundred-weight of beef, and boil it in the coppers.”</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, the surgeon went to the cook, and very soon beef was steaming on a scale and at a rate unparalleled.</p>
<p>Meantime, Captain Dodd had the patient taken to his own cabin, and he and his servant administered weak brandy and water with great caution and skill.</p>
<p>There was no perceptible result. But at all events there was life and vital instinct left, or he could not have swallowed.</p>
<p>Thus they hovered about him for some hours, and then the bath was ready.</p>
<p>The captain took charge of the patient’s clothes: the surgeon and a sailor bathed him in lukewarm beef-tea, and then covered him very warm with blankets next the skin. Guess how near a thing it seemed to them, when I tell you they dared not rub him.</p>
<p>Just before sunset his pulse became perceptible. The surgeon administered half a spoonful of egg-flip. The patient swallowed it.</p>
<p>By and by he sighed.</p>
<p>“He must not be left, day or night,” said the captain. “I don’t know who or what he is, but he is a man; and I could not bear him to die now.”</p>
<p>That night Captain Dodd overhauled the patient’s clothes, and looked for marks on his linen. There were none.</p>
<p>“Poor devil” said Captain Dodd. “He is a bachelor.”</p>
<p>Captain Dodd found his pocket-book, with bank-notes, two hundred pounds. He took the numbers, made a memorandum of them, and locked the notes up.</p>
<p>He lighted his lamp, examined the belt, unripped it, and poured out the contents on his table.</p>
<p>They were dazzling. A great many large pieces of amethyst, and some of white topaz and rock crystal; a large number of smaller stones, carbuncles, chrysolites, and not a few emeralds. Dodd looked at them with pleasure, sparkling in the lamplight.</p>
<p>“What a lot!” said he. “I wonder what they are worth!” He sent for the first mate, who, he knew, did a little private business in precious stones. “Masterton,” said he, “oblige me by counting these stones with me, and valuing them.”</p>
<p>Mr. Masterton stared, and his mouth watered. However, he named the various stones and valued them. He said there was one stone, a large emerald, without a flaw, that was worth a heavy sum by itself; and the pearls, very fine: and looking at the great number, they must be worth a thousand pounds.</p>
<p>Captain Dodd then entered the whole business carefully in the ship’s log: the living man he described thus: “About five feet six in height, and about fifty years of age.” Then he described the notes and the stones very exactly, and made Masterton, the valuer, sign the log.</p>
<p>Staines took a good deal of egg-flip that night, and next day ate solid food; but they questioned him in vain; his reason was entirely in abeyance: he had become an eater, and nothing else. Whenever they gave him food, he showed a sort of fawning animal gratitude. Other sentiment he had none, nor did words enter his mind any more than a bird’s. And since it is not pleasant to dwell on the wreck of a fine understanding, I will only say that they landed him at Cape Town, out of bodily danger, but weak, and his mind, to all appearance, a hopeless blank.</p>
<p>They buried the skeleton,—read the service of the English Church over a Malabar heathen.</p>
<p>Dodd took Staines to the hospital, and left twenty pounds with the governor of it to cure him. But he deposited Staines’s money and jewels with a friendly banker, and begged that the principal cashier might see the man, and be able to recognize him, should he apply for his own.</p>
<p>The cashier came and examined him, and also the ruby ring on his finger—a parting gift from Rosa—and remarked this was a new way of doing business.</p>
<p>“Why, it is the only one, sir,” said Dodd. “How can we give you his signature? He is not in his right mind.”</p>
<p>“Nor never will be.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that, sir. Let us hope for the best, poor fellow.”</p>
<p>Having made these provisions, the worthy captain weighed anchor, with a warm heart and a good conscience. Yet the image of the man he had saved pursued him, and he resolved to look after him next time he should coal at Cape Town, homeward bound.</p>
<p>Staines recovered his strength in about two months; but his mind returned in fragments, and very slowly. For a long, long time he remembered nothing that had preceded his great calamity. His mind started afresh, aided only by certain fixed habits; for instance, he could read and write: but, strange as it may appear, he had no idea who he was; and when his memory cleared a little on that head, he thought his surname was Christie, but he was not sure.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the presiding physician discovered in him a certain progress of intelligence, which gave him great hopes. In the fifth month, having shown a marked interest in the other sick patients, coupled with a disposition to be careful and attentive, they made him a nurse, or rather a sub-nurse under the special orders of a responsible nurse. I really believe it was done at first to avoid the alternative of sending him adrift, or transferring him to the insane ward of the hospital. In this congenial pursuit he showed such watchfulness and skill, that by and by they found they had got a treasure. Two months after that he began to talk about medicine, and astonished them still more. He became the puzzle of the establishment. The doctor and surgeon would converse with him, and try and lead him to his past life; but when it came to that, he used to put his hands to his head with a face of great distress, and it was clear some impassable barrier lay between his growing intelligence and the past events of his life. Indeed, on one occasion, he said to his kind friend the doctor, “The past!—a black wall! a black wall!”</p>
<p>Ten months after his admission he was promoted to be an attendant, with a salary.</p>
<p>He put by every shilling of it; for he said, “A voice from the dark past tells me money is everything in this world.”</p>
<p>A discussion was held by the authorities as to whether he should be informed he had money and jewels at the bank or not.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, it was thought advisable to postpone this information, lest he should throw it away; but they told him he had been picked up at sea, and both money and jewels found on him; they were in safe hands, only the person was away for the time. Still, he was not to look upon himself as either friendless or moneyless.</p>
<p>At this communication he showed an almost childish delight, that confirmed the doctor in his opinion he was acting prudently, and for the real benefit of an amiable and afflicted person, not yet to be trusted with money and jewels.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00019">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<p>In his quality of attendant on the sick, Staines sometimes conducted a weak but convalescent patient into the open air; and he was always pleased to do this, for the air of the Cape carries health and vigor on its wings. He had seen its fine recreative properties, and he divined, somehow, that the minds of convalescents ought to be amused, and so he often begged the doctor to let him take a convalescent abroad. Sooner than not, he would draw the patient several miles in a Bath chair. He rather liked this; for he was a Hercules, and had no egotism or false pride where the sick were concerned.</p>
<p>Now, these open-air walks exerted a beneficial influence on his own darkened mind. It is one thing to struggle from idea to idea; it is another when material objects mingle with the retrospect; they seem to supply stepping-stones in the gradual resuscitation of memory and reason.</p>
<p>The ships going out of port were such a steppingstone to him, and a vague consciousness came back to him of having been in a ship.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, along with this reminiscence came a desire to go in one again; and this sowed discontent in his mind, and the more that mind enlarged, the more he began to dislike the hospital and its confinement. The feeling grew, and bade fair to disqualify him for his humble office. The authorities could not fail to hear of this, and they had a little discussion about parting with him; but they hesitated to turn him adrift, and they still doubted the propriety of trusting him with money and jewels.</p>
<p>While matters were in this state a remarkable event occurred. He drew a sick patient down to the quay one morning, and watched the business of the port with the keenest interest. A ship at anchor was unloading, and a great heavy boat was sticking to her side like a black leech. Presently this boat came away, and moved sluggishly towards the shore, rather by help of the tide than of the two men who went through the form of propelling her with two monstrous sweeps, while a third steered her. She contained English goods: agricultural implements, some cases, four horses, and a buxom young woman with a thorough English face. The woman seemed a little excited, and as she neared the landing-place, she called out in jocund tones to a young man on the shore, “It is all right, Dick; they are beauties,” and she patted the beasts as people do who are fond of them.</p>
<p>She stepped lightly ashore, and then came the slower work of landing her imports. She bustled about, like a hen over her brood, and wasn’t always talking, but put in her word every now and then, never crossly, and always to the point.</p>
<p>Staines listened to her, and examined her with a sort of puzzled look; but she took no notice of him; her whole soul was in the cattle.</p>
<p>They got the things on board well enough; but the horses were frightened at the gangway, and jibbed. Then a man was for driving them, and poked one of them in the quarter; he snorted and reared directly.</p>
<p>“Man alive!” cried the young woman, “that is not the way. They are docile enough, but frightened. Encourage ‘em, and let ‘em look at it. Give ‘em time. More haste less speed, with timorous cattle.”</p>
<p>“That is a very pleasant voice,” said poor Staines, rather more dictatorially than became the present state of his intellect. He added softly, “a true woman’s voice;” then gloomily, “a voice of the past—the dark, dark past.”</p>
<p>At this speech intruding itself upon the short sentences of business, there was a roar of laughter, and Phoebe Falcon turned sharply round to look at the speaker. She stared at him; she cried “Oh!” and clasped her hands, and colored all over. “Why, sure,” said she, “I can’t be mistook. Those eyes—‘tis you, doctor, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Doctor?” said Staines, with a puzzled look. “Yes; I think they called me doctor once. I’m an attendant in the hospital now.”</p>
<p>“Dick!” cried Phoebe, in no little agitation. “Come here this minute.”</p>
<p>“What, afore I get the horses ashore?”</p>
<p>“Ay, before you do another thing, or say another word. Come here, now.” So he came, and she told him to take a good look at the man. “Now,” said she, “who is that?”</p>
<p>“Blest if I know,” said he.</p>
<p>“What, not know the man who saved your own life! Oh, Dick, what are your eyes worth?”</p>
<p>This discourse brought the few persons within hearing into one band of excited starers.</p>
<p>Dick took a good look, and said, “I’m blest if I don’t, though; it is the doctor that cut my throat.”</p>
<p>This strange statement drew forth quite a shout of ejaculations.</p>
<p>“Oh, better breathe through a slit than not at all,” said Dick. “Saved my life with that cut, he did, didn’t he, Pheeb?”</p>
<p>“That he did, Dick. Dear heart, I hardly know whether I am in my senses or not, seeing him a-looking so blank. You try him.”</p>
<p>Dick came forward. “Sure you remember me, sir. Dick Dale. You cut my throat, and saved my life.”</p>
<p>“Cut your throat! why, that would kill you.”</p>
<p>“Not the way you done it. Well, sir, you ain’t the man you was, that is clear; but you was a good friend to me, and there’s my hand.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Dick,” said Staines, and took his hand. “I don’t remember YOU. Perhaps you are one of the past. The past is dead wall to me—a dark dead wall,” and he put his hands to his head with a look of distress.</p>
<p>Everybody there now suspected the truth, and some pointed mysteriously to their own heads.</p>
<p>Phoebe whispered an inquiry to the sick person.</p>
<p>He said a little pettishly, “All I know is, he is the kindest attendant in the ward, and very attentive.”</p>
<p>“Oh, then, he is in the public hospital.”</p>
<p>“Of course he is.”</p>
<p>The invalid, with the selfishness of his class, then begged Staines to take him out of all this bustle down to the beach. Staines complied at once, with the utmost meekness, and said, “Good-by, old friends; forgive me for not remembering you. It is my great affliction that the past is gone from me—gone, gone.” And he went sadly away, drawing his sick charge like a patient mule.</p>
<p>Phoebe Falcon looked after him, and began to cry.</p>
<p>“Nay, nay, Phoebe,” said Dick; “don’t ye take on about it.”</p>
<p>“I wonder at you,” sobbed Phoebe. “Good people, I’m fonder of my brother than he is of himself, it seems; for I can’t take it so easy. Well, the world is full of trouble. Let us do what we are here for. But I shall pray for the poor soul every night, that his mind may be given back to him.”</p>
<p>So then she bustled, and gave herself to getting the cattle on shore, and the things put on board her wagon.</p>
<p>But when this was done, she said to her brother, “Dick, I did not think anything on earth could take my heart off the cattle and the things we have got from home; but I can’t leave this without going to the hospital about our poor dear doctor: and it is late for making a start, any way—and you mustn’t forget the newspapers for Reginald—he is so fond of them—and you must contrive to have one sent out regular after this, and I’ll go to the hospital.”</p>
<p>She went, and saw the head doctor, and told him he had got an attendant there she had known in England in a very different condition, and she had come to see if there was anything she could do for him—for she felt very grateful to him, and grieved to see him so.</p>
<p>The doctor was pleased and surprised, and put several questions.</p>
<p>Then she gave him a clear statement of what he had done for Dick in England.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the doctor, “I believe it is the same man; for, now you tell me this—yes, one of the nurses told me he knew more about medicine than she did. His name, if you please.”</p>
<p>“His name, sir?”</p>
<p>“Yes, his name. Of course you know his name. Is it Christie?”</p>
<p>“Doctor,” said Phoebe, blushing, “I don’t know what you will think of me, but I don’t know his name. Laws forgive me, I never had the sense to ask it.”</p>
<p>A shade of suspicion crossed the doctor’s face.</p>
<p>Phoebe saw it, and colored to the temples. “Oh, sir,” she cried piteously, “don’t go for to think I have told you a lie! why should I? and indeed I am not of that sort, nor Dick neither. Sir, I’ll bring him to you, and he will say the same. Well, we were all in terror and confusion, and I met him accidentally in the street. He was only a customer till then, and paid ready money, so that is how I never knew his name, but if I hadn’t been the greatest fool in England, I should have asked his wife.”</p>
<p>“What! he has a wife?”</p>
<p>“Ay, sir, the loveliest lady you ever clapped eyes on, and he is almost as handsome; has eyes in his head like jewels; ‘twas by them I knew him on the quay, and I think he knew my voice again, said as good as he had heard it in past times.”</p>
<p>“Did he? Then we have got him,” cried the doctor energetically.</p>
<p>“La, Sir.”</p>
<p>“Yes; if he knows your voice, you will be able in time to lead his memory back; at least, I think so. Do you live in Cape Town?”</p>
<p>“Dear heart, no. I live at my own farm, a hundred and eighty miles from this.”</p>
<p>“What a pity!”</p>
<p>“Why, sir?”</p>
<p>“Well—hum!”</p>
<p>“Oh, if you think I could do the poor doctor good by having him with me, you have only to say the word, and out he goes with Dick and me to-morrow morning. We should have started for home to-night, but for this.”</p>
<p>“Are you in earnest, madam?” said the doctor, opening his eyes. “Would you really encumber yourself with a person whose reason is in suspense, and may never return?”</p>
<p>“But that is not his fault, sir. Why, if a dog had saved my brother’s life, I’d take it home, and keep it all its days; and this is a man, and a worthy man. Oh, sir, when I saw him brought down so, and his beautiful eyes clouded like, my very bosom yearned over the poor soul; a kind act done in dear old England, who can see the man in trouble here, and not repay it—ay, if it cost one’s blood. But indeed he is strong and healthy, and hands are always scarce our way, and the odds are he will earn his meat one way or t’other; and if he doesn’t, why, all the better for me; I shall have the pleasure of serving him for nought that once served me for neither money nor reward.”</p>
<p>“You are a good woman,” said the doctor warmly.</p>
<p>“There’s better, and there’s worse,” said Phoebe quietly, and even a little coldly.</p>
<p>“More of the latter,” said the doctor dryly. “Well, Mrs.—?”</p>
<p>“Falcon, sir.”</p>
<p>“We shall hand him over to your care: but first—just for form—if you are a married woman, we should like to see Dick here: he is your husband, I presume.”</p>
<p>Ploebe laughed merrily. “Dick is my brother; and he can’t be spared to come here. Dick! he’d say black was white if I told him to.”</p>
<p>“Then let us see your husband about it—just for form.”</p>
<p>“My husband is at the farm. I could not venture so far away, and not leave him in charge.” If she had said, “I will not bring him into temptation,” that would have been nearer the truth. “Let that fly stick on the wall, sir. What I do, my husband will approve.”</p>
<p>“I see how it is. You rule the roost.”</p>
<p>Phoebe did not reply point-blank to that; she merely said, “All my chickens are happy, great and small,” and an expression of lofty, womanly, innocent pride illuminated her face and made it superb for a moment.</p>
<p>In short, it was settled that Staines should accompany her next morning to Dale’s Kloof Farm, if he chose. On inquiry, it appeared that he had just returned to the hospital with his patient. He was sent for, and Phoebe asked him sweetly if he would go with her to her house, one hundred and eighty miles away, and she would be kind to him.</p>
<p>“On the water?”</p>
<p>“Nay, by land; but ‘tis a fine country, and you will see beautiful deer and things running across the plains, and”—</p>
<p>“Shall I find the past again, the past again?”</p>
<p>“Ay, poor soul, that we shall, God willing. You and I, we will hunt it together.”</p>
<p>He looked at her, and gave her his hand. “I will go with you. Your face belongs to the past, so does your voice.”</p>
<p>He then inquired, rather abruptly, had she any children. She smiled.</p>
<p>“Ay, that I have, the loveliest little boy you ever saw. When you are as you used to be, you will be his doctor, won’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I will nurse him, and you will help me find the past.”</p>
<p>Phoebe then begged Staines to be ready to start at six in the morning. She and Dick would take him up on their way.</p>
<p>While she was talking to him the doctor slipped out, and to tell the truth he went to consult with another authority, whether he should take this opportunity of telling Staines that he had money and jewels at the bank: he himself was half inclined to do so; but the other, who had not seen Phoebe’s face, advised him to do nothing of the kind. “They are always short of money, these colonial farmers,” said he; “she would get every shilling out of him.”</p>
<p>“Most would; but this is such an honest face.”</p>
<p>“Well, but she is a mother, you say.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Well, what mother could be just to a lunatic, with her own sweet angel babes to provide for?”</p>
<p>“That is true,” said Dr. ——. “Maternal love is apt to modify the conscience.”</p>
<p>“What I would do,—I would take her address, and make her promise to write if he gets well, and if he does get well then write to HIM, and tell him all about it.”</p>
<p>Dr. —— acted on this shrewd advice, and ordered a bundle to be made up for the traveller out of the hospital stores: it contained a nice light summer suit and two changes of linen.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00020">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<p>Next morning, Staines and Dick Dale walked through the streets of Cape Town side by side. Dick felt the uneasiness of a sane man, not familiar with the mentally afflicted, who suddenly finds himself alone with one. Insanity turns men oftenest into sheep and hares; but it does now and then make them wolves and tigers; and that has saddled the insane in general with a character for ferocity. Young Dale, then, cast many a suspicious glance at his comrade, as he took him along. These glances were reassuring: Christopher’s face had no longer the mobility, the expressive changes, that mark the superior mind; his countenance was monotonous: but the one expression was engaging; there was a sweet, patient, lamb-like look: the glorious eye a little troubled and perplexed, but wonderfully mild. Dick Dale looked and looked, and his uneasiness vanished. And the more he looked, the more did a certain wonder creep over him, and make him scarce believe the thing he knew; viz., that a learned doctor had saved him from the jaws of death by rare knowledge, sagacity, courage, and skill combined: and that mighty man of wisdom was brought down to this lamb, and would go north, south, east, or west, with sweet and perfect submission, even as he, Dick Dale, should appoint. With these reflections honest Dick felt his eyes get a little misty, and, to use those words of Scripture, which nothing can surpass or equal, his bowels yearned over the man.</p>
<p>As for Christopher, he looked straight forward, and said not a word till they cleared the town; but when he saw the vast flowery vale, and the far-off violet hills, like Scotland glorified, he turned to Dick with an ineffable expression of sweetness and good fellowship, and said, “Oh, beautiful! We’ll hunt the past together.”</p>
<p>“We—will—SO,” said Dick, with a sturdy and indeed almost a stern resolution.</p>
<p>Now, this he said, not that he cared for the past, nor intended to waste the present by going upon its predecessor’s trail; but he had come to a resolution—full three minutes ago—to humor his companion to the top of his bent, and say “Yes” with hypocritical vigor to everything not directly and immediately destructive to him and his.</p>
<p>The next moment they turned a corner and came upon the rest of their party, hitherto hidden by the apricot hedge and a turning in the road. A blue-black Kafir, with two yellow Hottentot drivers, man and boy, was harnessing, in the most primitive mode, four horses on to the six oxen attached to the wagon; and the horses were flattening their ears, and otherwise resenting the incongruity. Meantime a fourth figure, a colossal young Kafir woman, looked on superior with folded arms, like a sable Juno looking down with that absolute composure upon the struggles of man and other animals, which Lucretius and his master Epicurus assigned to the Divine nature. Without jesting, the grandeur, majesty, and repose of this figure were unsurpassable in nature, and such as have vanished from sculpture two thousand years and more.</p>
<p>Dick Dale joined the group immediately, and soon arranged the matter. Meantime, Phoebe descended from the wagon, and welcomed Christopher very kindly, and asked him if he would like to sit beside her, or to walk.</p>
<p>He glanced into the wagon; it was covered and curtained, and dark as a cupboard. “I think,” said he, timidly, “I shall see more of the past out here.”</p>
<p>“So you will, poor soul,” said Phoebe kindly, “and better for your health: but you must not go far from the wagon, for I’m a fidget; and I have got the care of you now, you know, for want of a better. Come, Ucatella; you must ride with me, and help me sort the things; they are all higgledy-piggledy.” So those two got into the wagon through the back curtains. Then the Kafir driver flourished his kambok, or long whip, in the air, and made it crack like a pistol, and the horses reared, and the oxen started and slowly bored in between them, for they whinnied, and kicked, and spread out like a fan all over the road; but a flick or two from the terrible kambok soon sent them bleeding and trembling and rubbing shoulders, and the oxen, mildly but persistently goring their recalcitrating haunches, the intelligent animals went ahead, and revenged themselves by breaking the harness. But that goes for little in Cape travel.</p>
<p>The body of the wagon was long and low and very stout. The tilt strong and tight-made. The roof inside, and most of the sides, lined with green baize. Curtains of the same to the little window and the back. There was a sort of hold literally built full of purchases; a small fireproof safe; huge blocks of salt; saws, axes, pickaxes, adzes, flails, tools innumerable, bales of wool and linen stuff, hams, and two hundred empty sacks strewn over all. In large pigeon-holes fixed to the sides were light goods, groceries, collars, glaring cotton handkerchiefs for Phoebe’s aboriginal domestics, since not every year did she go to Cape Town, a twenty days’ journey by wagon: things dangled from the very roof; but no hard goods there, if you please, to batter one’s head in a spill. Outside were latticed grooves with tent, tent-poles, and rifles. Great pieces of cork, and bags of hay and corn, hung dangling from mighty hooks—the latter to feed the cattle, should they be compelled to camp out on some sterile spot on the Veldt, and methinks to act as buffers, should the whole concern roll down a nullah or little precipice, no very uncommon incident in the blessed region they must pass to reach Dale’s Kloof.</p>
<p>Harness mended; fresh start. The Hottentots and Kafir vociferated and yelled, and made the unearthly row of a dozen wild beasts wrangling: the horses drew the bullocks, they the wagon; it crawled and creaked, and its appendages wobbled finely.</p>
<p>Slowly they creaked and wobbled past apricot hedges and detached houses and huts, and got into an open country without a tree, but here and there a stunted camel-thorn. The soil was arid, and grew little food for man or beast; yet, by a singular freak of nature, it put forth abundantly things that here at home we find it harder to raise than homely grass and oats; the ground was thickly clad with flowers of delightful hues; pyramids of snow or rose-color bordered the track; yellow and crimson stars bejewelled the ground, and a thousand bulbous plants burst into all imaginable colors, and spread a rainbow carpet to the foot of the violet hills; and all this glowed, and gleamed, and glittered in a sun shining with incredible brightness and purity of light, but, somehow, without giving a headache or making the air sultry.</p>
<p>Christopher fell to gathering flowers, and interrogating the past by means of them; for he had studied botany: the past gave him back some pitiably vague ideas. He sighed. “Never mind,” said he to Dick, and tapped his forehead: “it is here: it is only locked up.”</p>
<p>“All right,” said Dick; “nothing is lost when you know where ‘tis.”</p>
<p>“This is a beautiful country,” suggested Christopher. “It is all flowers. It is like the garden of—the garden of—locked up.”</p>
<p>“It is de—light—ful,” replied the self-compelled optimist sturdily. But here nature gave way; he was obliged to relieve his agricultural bile by getting into the cart and complaining to his sister. “‘Twill take us all our time to cure him. He have been bepraising this here soil, which it is only fit to clean the women’s kettles. ‘Twouldn’t feed three larks to an acre, I know; no, NOR HALF SO MANY.”</p>
<p>“Poor soul! mayhap the flowers have took his eye. Sit here a bit, Dick. I want to talk to you about a many things.”</p>
<p>While these two were conversing, Ucatella, who was very fond of Phoebe, but abhorred wagons, stepped out and stalked by the side, like an ostrich, a camelopard, or a Taglioni; nor did the effort with which she subdued her stride to the pace of the procession appear: it was the poetry of walking. Christopher admired it a moment; but the noble expanse tempted him, and he strode forth like a giant, his lungs inflating in the glorious air, and soon left the wagon far behind.</p>
<p>The consequence was that when they came to a halt, and Dick and Phoebe got out to release and water the cattle, there was Christopher’s figure retiring into space.</p>
<p>“Hanc rem aegre tulit Phoebe,” as my old friend Livy would say. “Oh dear! oh dear! if he strays so far from us, he will be eaten up at nightfall by jackals, or lions, or something. One of you must go after him.”</p>
<p>“Me go, missy,” said Ucatella zealously, pleased with an excuse for stretching her magnificent limbs.</p>
<p>“Ay, but mayhap he will not come back with YOU: will he, Dick?”</p>
<p>“That he will, like a lamb.” Dick wanted to look after the cattle.</p>
<p>“Yuke, my girl,” said Phoebe, “listen. He has been a good friend of ours in trouble; and now he is not quite right HERE. So be very kind to him, but be sure and bring him back, or keep him till we come.”</p>
<p>“Me bring him back alive, certain sure,” said Ucatella, smiling from ear to ear. She started with a sudden glide, like a boat taking the water, and appeared almost to saunter away, so easy was the motion; but when you looked at the ground she was covering, the stride, or glide, or whatever it was, was amazing.</p>
<p>“She seem’d in walking to devour the way.”</p>
<p>Christopher walked fast, but nothing like this; and as he stopped at times to botanize and gaze at the violet hills, and interrogate the past, she came up with him about five miles from the halting-place.</p>
<p>She laid her hand quietly on his shoulder, and said, with a broad genial smile, and a musical chuckle, “Ucatella come for you. Missy want to speak you.”</p>
<p>“Oh! very well;” and he turned back with her, directly; but she took him by the hand to make sure; and they marched back peaceably, in silence, and hand in hand. But he looked and looked at her, and at last he stopped dead short, and said, a little arrogantly, “Come, I know YOU. YOU are not locked up;” and he inspected her point-blank. She stood like an antique statue, and faced the examination. “You are ‘the noble savage,’” said he, having concluded his inspection.</p>
<p>“Nay,” said she. “I be the housemaid.”</p>
<p>“The housemaid?”</p>
<p>“Iss, the housemaid, Ucatella. So come on.” And she drew him along, sore perplexed.</p>
<p>They met the cavalcade a mile from the halting-place, and Phoebe apologized a little to Christopher. “I hope you’ll excuse me, sir,” said she, “but I am just for all the world like a hen with her chickens; if but one strays, I’m all in a flutter till I get him back.”</p>
<p>“Madam,” said Christopher, “I am very unhappy at the way things are locked up. Please tell me truly, is this ‘the housemaid,’ or ‘the noble savage’?”</p>
<p>“Well, she is both, if you go to that, and the best creature ever breathed.”</p>
<p>“Then she IS ‘the noble savage’?”</p>
<p>“Ay, so they call her, because she is black.”</p>
<p>“Then, thank Heaven,” said Christopher, “the past is not all locked up.”</p>
<p>That afternoon they stopped at an inn. But Dick slept in the cart. At three in the morning they took the road again, and creaked along supernaturally loud under a purple firmament studded with huge stars, all bright as moons, that lit the way quite clear, and showed black things innumerable flitting to and fro; these made Phoebe shudder, but were no doubt harmless; still Dick carried his double rifle, and a revolver in his belt.</p>
<p>They made a fine march in the cool, until some slight mists gathered, and then they halted and breakfasted near a silvery kloof, and watered the cattle. While thus employed, suddenly a golden tinge seemed to fall like a lash on the vapors of night; they scudded away directly, as jackals before the lion; the stars paled, and with one incredible bound, the mighty sun leaped into the horizon, and rose into the sky. In a moment all the lesser lamps of heaven were out, though late so glorious, and there was nothing but one vast vaulted turquoise, and a great flaming topaz mounting with eternal ardor to its centre.</p>
<p>This did not escape Christopher. “What is this?” said he. “No twilight. The tropics!” He managed to dig that word out of the past in a moment.</p>
<p>At ten o’clock the sun was so hot that they halted, and let the oxen loose till sun-down. Then they began to climb the mountains.</p>
<p>The way was steep and rugged; indeed, so rough in places, that the cattle had to jump over the holes, and as the wagon could not jump so cleverly, it jolted appallingly, and many a scream issued forth.</p>
<p>Near the summit, when the poor beasts were dead beat, they got into clouds and storms, and the wind rushed howling at them through the narrow pass with such fury it flattened the horses’ ears, and bade fair to sweep the whole cavalcade to the plains below.</p>
<p>Christopher and Dick walked close behind, under the lee of the wagon. Christopher said in Dick’s ear, “D’ye hear that? Time to reef topsails, captain.”</p>
<p>“It is time to do SOMETHING,” said Dick. He took advantage of a jutting rock, drew the wagon half behind it and across the road, propped the wheels with stones, and they all huddled to leeward, man and beast indiscriminately.</p>
<p>“Ah!” said Christopher, approvingly; “we are lying to: a very—proper—course.”</p>
<p>They huddled and shivered three hours, and then the sun leaped into the sky, and lo! a transformation scene. The cold clouds were first rosy fleeces, then golden ones, then gold-dust, then gone; the rain was big diamonds, then crystal sparks, then gone; the rocks and the bushes sparkled with gem-like drops, and shone and smiled.</p>
<p>The shivering party bustled, and toasted the potent luminary in hot coffee; for Phoebe’s wagon had a stove and chimney; and then they yoked their miscellaneous cattle again, and breasted the hill. With many a jump, and bump, and jolt, and scream from inside, they reached the summit, and looked down on a vast slope, flowering but arid, a region of gaudy sterility.</p>
<p>The descent was more tremendous than the ascent, and Phoebe got out, and told Christopher she would liever cross the ocean twice than this dreadful mountain once.</p>
<p>The Hottentot with the reins was now bent like a bow all the time, keeping the cattle from flowing diverse over precipices, and the Kafir with his kambok was here, and there, and everywhere, his whip flicking like a lancet, and cracking like a horse-pistol, and the pair vied like Apollo and Pan, not which could sing sweetest, but swear loudest. Having the lofty hill for some hours between them and the sun, they bumped, and jolted, and stuck in mud-holes, and flogged and swore the cattle out of them again, till at last they got to the bottom, where ran a turbid kloof or stream. It was fordable, but the recent rains had licked away the slope; so the existing bank was two feet above the stream. Little recked the demon drivers or the parched cattle; in they plunged promiscuously, with a flop like thunder, followed by an awful splashing. The wagon stuck fast in the mud, the horses tied themselves in a knot, and rolled about in the stream, and the oxen drank imperturbably.</p>
<p>“Oh, the salt! the salt!” screamed Phoebe, and the rocks re-echoed her lamentations.</p>
<p>The wagon was inextricable, the cattle done up, the savages lazy, so they stayed for several hours. Christopher botanized, but not alone. Phoebe drew Ucatella apart, and explained to her that when a man is a little wrong in the head, it makes a child of him: “So,” said she, “you must think he is your child, and never let him out of your sight.”</p>
<p>“All right,” said the sable Juno, who spoke English ridiculously well, and rapped out idioms; especially “Come on,” and “All right.”</p>
<p>About dusk, what the drivers had foreseen, though they had not the sense to explain it, took place; the kloof dwindled to a mere gutter, and the wagon stuck high and dry. Phoebe waved her handkerchief to Ucatella. Ucatella, who had dogged Christopher about four hours without a word, now took his hand, and said, “My child, missy wants us; come on;” and so led him unresistingly.</p>
<p>The drivers, flogging like devils, cursing like troopers, and yelling like hyenas gone mad, tried to get the wagon off; but it was fast as a rock. Then Dick and the Hottentot put their shoulders to one wheel, and tried to prise it up, while the Kafir ENCOURAGED the cattle with his thong. Observing this, Christopher went in, with his sable custodian at his heels, and heaved at the other embedded wheel. The wagon was lifted directly, so that the cattle tugged it out, and they got clear. On examination, the salt had just escaped.</p>
<p>Says Ucatella to Phoebe, a little ostentatiously, “My child is strong and useful; make little missy a good slave.”</p>
<p>“A slave! Heaven forbid!” said Phoebe. “He’ll be a father to us all, once he gets his head back; and I do think it is coming—but very slow.”</p>
<p>The next three days offered the ordinary incidents of African travel, but nothing that operated much on Christopher’s mind, which is the true point of this narrative; and as there are many admirable books of African travel, it is the more proper I should confine myself to what may be called the relevant incidents of the journey.</p>
<p>On the sixth day from Cape Town, they came up with a large wagon stuck in a mud-hole. There was quite a party of Boers, Hottentots, Kafirs, round it, armed with whips, shamboks, and oaths, lashing and cursing without intermission, or any good effect; and there were the wretched beasts straining in vain at their choking yokes, moaning with anguish, trembling with terror, their poor mild eyes dilated with agony and fear, and often, when the blows of the cruel shamboks cut open their bleeding flesh, they bellowed to Heaven their miserable and vain protest against this devil’s work.</p>
<p>Then the past opened its stores, and lent Christopher a word.</p>
<p>“BARBARIANS!” he roared, and seized a gigantic Kafir by the throat, just as his shambok descended for the hundredth time. There was a mighty struggle, as of two Titans; dust flew round the combatants in a cloud; a whirling of big bodies, and down they both went with an awful thud, the Saxon uppermost, by Nature’s law.</p>
<p>The Kafir’s companions, amazed at first, began to roll their eyes and draw a knife or two; but Dick ran forward, and said, “Don’t hurt him: he is wrong HERE.”</p>
<p>This representation pacified them more readily than one might have expected. Dick added hastily, “We’ll get you out of the hole OUR way, and cry quits.”</p>
<p>The proposal was favorably received, and the next minute Christopher and Ucatella at one wheel, and Dick and the Hottentot at the other, with no other help than two pointed iron bars bought for their shepherds, had effected what sixteen oxen could not. To do this Dick Dale had bared his arm to the shoulder; it was a stalwart limb, like his sister’s, and he now held it out all swollen and corded, and slapped it with his other hand. “Look’ee here, you chaps,” said he: “the worst use a man can put that there to is to go cutting out a poor beast’s heart for not doing more than he can. You are good fellows, you Kafirs; but I think you have sworn never to put your shoulder to a wheel. But, bless your poor silly hearts, a little strength put on at the right place is better than a deal at the wrong.”</p>
<p>“You hear that, you Kafir chaps?” inquired Ucatella, a little arrogantly—for a Kafir.</p>
<p>The Kafirs, who had stood quite silent to imbibe these remarks, bowed their heads with all the dignity and politeness of Roman senators, Spanish grandees, etc.; and one of the party replied gravely, “The words of the white man are always wise.”</p>
<p>“And his arm blanked* strong,” said Christopher’s late opponent, from whose mind, however, all resentment had vanished.</p>
